# Virtual-Paint-Project-1
Made a virtual paint software using OpenCV in C++ which recognises different colours and paints using tracking of the colours.
Use colordetection.cpp to get your desired colour values. 
colordetection.cpp will open 3 windows, use the value tab to distinguish the desired colour from the surroundings as white and everything else black. This can be observed in the mask tab. 
Input those values into virtualpaint.cpp .
And start Drawing :D
